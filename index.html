                <h1>Summary</h1>
                <p>I am a dedicated and versatile professional with ten years of expertise in combined management and customer service, along with a passion for AWS services. I have a proven record of reliability, problem-solving skills, and obtaining results to meet the requirements of local customers and international business partners. Recently, I completed 12 weeks of intense remote training with Generation on the AWS re/Start programme. During this time, I gained substantial knowledge of IT fundamental skills in Python, Linux Operating system, Databases, Networking, Security and AWS Cloud Computing. 
		<br> My career goal is to become a Solutions Architect and work within a company where I can utilise and develop the skills I currently possess. </p>

					"On the programme, I used a lab environment to create and troubleshoot different issues to complete tasks. I achieved hand-on experiences of the following: creating Amazon EC2 Instances, using Auto Scaling, working with AWS Lambda, working with Amazon S3, and creating and troubleshooting VPC. During labs, I used both the AWS management console and the AWS command line interface (AWS CLI) to complete various challenges. With such knowledge and skills, I can build a system that ensures scalability, high availability, and I can apply AWS recommended best practices. The behavioural skills and mindsets I acquired from completing the programme are: teamwork, time management, future orientation, and being persistent through the many challenges of completing an online programme.",

Through a partnership with someone, we secured funding and created a company to provide internet connectivity. We raised funds, acquired and renovated an old building, and purchased equipment. My role involved; set up and running of daily operations, troubleshooting any issues, including administrative tasks, using QuickBooks and Microsoft Office.  I built the IT system including; servers, network, and system configuration.  I provided tutorials for members of the community who were inexperienced with technology. In this role I learnt how to take personal responsibility, demonstrated persistence, teamwork, leadership and adopted the growth mindset.",
